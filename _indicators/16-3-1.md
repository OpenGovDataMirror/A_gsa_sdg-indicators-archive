  Reporting to competent authorities is the first step for crime victims to seek
  justice: if competent authorities are not alerted they are not in a condition
  to conduct proper investigations and administer justice. However, lack of
  trust and confidence in the ability of the police or other authorities to
  provide effective redress, or objective and subjective difficulties in
  accessing them, can influence negatively the reporting behaviour of crime
  victims. As such, reporting rates provide a direct measure of the confidence
  of victims of crime in the ability of the police or other authorities to
  provide assistance and bring perpetrators to justice. Reporting rates provide
  also a measure of the 'dark figure' of crime, that is the proportion of crimes
  not reported to the police. Trends in reporting rates of violent crime can be
  used to monitor public trust and confidence in competent authorities on the
  basis of actual behaviours and not perceptions.

  Proportion of victims of violence in the previous 12 months who reported their
  victimization to competent authorities or other officially recognized conflict
  resolution mechanisms
target: >-
  Promote the rule of law at the national and international levels and ensure
  equal access to justice for all.
indicator_definition: >-
  Number of victims of violent crime (physical or sexual assault) in the
  previous 12 months who reported their last incident to competent authorities
  or other officially recognized conflict resolution mechanisms, as a percentage
  of all victims of crime in the previous 12 months. Competent authorities
  includes police, prosecutors or other authorities with competencies to
  investigate certain crimes (such as corruption or fraud), while 'other
  officially recognised conflict resolution mechanisms' may include a variety of
  institutions with a role in the informal justice or dispute resolution (e.g.
  tribal or religious leaders, village elders, community leaders), provided
  their role is officially recognised by state authorities.

  Data are derived from the National Crime Victimization Survey - a self-report
  survey in which interviewed persons are asked about the number and
  characteristics of victimization experienced during the prior 6 months. The
  responses are aggregated for a 12-month period (based on 2 interviews). The
  survey is administered to persons age 12 or older from a nationally
  representative sample of households. In 2016, 134,690 households and 224,520
  persons age 12 or older were interviewed. The response rate was 78% for
  households and 84% for eligible persons.

  The indicator is subject to sampling error. The national estimate in 2016 had
  a standard error of 2.10%. For other years, see NCVS page on BJS website:
