indicator_name: Global food loss index
target: >-
  By 2030, halve per capita global food waste at the retail and consumer levels
  and reduce food losses along production and supply chains, including
  post-harvest losses.
indicator_definition: >-
  The indicator measures the totality of losses occurring from the time at which
  production of an agricultural product is recorded until it reaches the final
  consumer as food. While calculated on a quantity basis, it is subsequently
  transformed to dietary energy supplies (in kcal) per capita allowing
  consistent aggregation and then indexed. The indicator will be calculated on
  an annual frequency broken down by country and commodity.
