  Remittances are an important private source of income for migrant families.
  They benefit wider communities and improve the human development of migrant
  households. With total remittances going to developing countries projected at
  USD 454 billion in 2015, reaching the target of reducing remittances to less
  than 3% would save more than USD 20 billion/year. The G20 has already
  committed to reducing the transfer costs of remittances (with 5 percentage
  points over five years), the so'called '5x 5 initiative'. To monitor this
  commitment, a designated group in the World bank was created to monitor the
  implementation of this commitment.
