  This indicator is a measure of relative income poverty at the national level.
  It measures how far individuals are from the median standard of living,
  approximating a measure of social exclusion. Persons living in relative
  poverty often experience many other forms of social and economic disadvantage
  through unemployment, poor housing, inadequate health care and barriers in
  accessing education and economic, social, political and cultural activities,
  which can result from social stigmatisation.
