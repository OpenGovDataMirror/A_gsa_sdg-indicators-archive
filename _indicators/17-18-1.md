target: >-
  By 2020, enhance capacity-building support to developing countries, including
  for least developed countries and small island developing States, to increase
  significantly the availability of high-quality, timely and reliable data
  disaggregated by income, gender, age, race, ethnicity, migratory status,
  disability, geographic location and other characteristics relevant in national
  contexts.
indicator_definition: >-
  The ability of National Statistical Offices and other bodies within countries
  to report on the diversity of SDG indicators is itself a measure of capacity,
  particularly when we think about the eventual complexity of the indicator
  framework as well as the points of disaggregation. Right now, a number of the
  existing indicators are calculated or modeled at global level, and the purpose
  of this indicator is to measure the shift in that calculation process to the
  national level. Disaggregation would be assessed on the basis of the language
  of target 17.18, as well as the metadata and agreements on disaggregation for
  each indicator itself. The baseline and targets for this indicators will be
  determined in a later stage using trend data on the MDGs reporting and
  independent assessments of current capacity of countries for reporting towards
  the final results framework and indicators for the SDGs.
