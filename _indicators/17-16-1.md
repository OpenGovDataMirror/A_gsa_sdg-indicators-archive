  Development processes are driven by the contributions and the concerted
  efforts of multiple actors, including government authorities, providers of
  development co-operation, the private sector, civil society and others. Strong
  multi-stakeholder partnerships provide an enabling environment for greater
  development effectiveness. In this regard, mutual accountability in between
  the relevant stakeholders participating in development efforts can enhance the
  quality and strength of these partnerships. 

  Mutual assessment reviews are national exercises that engage both developing
  country authorities and providers of development co-operation, as well as
  other stakeholders, at the senior level in a mutual performance review. These
  reviews should ideally be conducted through inclusive dialogues involving a
  broad range of government ministries; providers of development co-operation
  (including bilateral, multilateral, and global initiatives); as well as other
  stakeholders, including parliamentarians, local governments, the private
  sector, and civil society organisations (referred to as "non-executive"
  stakeholders). These assessments should be done regularly (every one to two
  years).

indicator_definition: "A country is considered to have a mutual assessment of progress in place when at least 4 out of 5 of the following criteria are met: \tAn aid policy or partnership policy defines the country's development co-operation priorities. \tNational targets for effective development co-operation exist for both the developing country government and providers of development co-operation. \tProgress has been assessed regularly and jointly by government and providers at the senior level in the past two years. \tLocal governments and non-executive stakeholders have been actively involved in these reviews. \tThe comprehensive results of the review have been made public in a timely manner."
