  The reduction of average tariff on key sector as agriculture can represent a
  proxy of the level of commitment of developed country to improve market access
  conditions. As it was done for MDG 8.7, the term "key sector" has to be
  interpreted as those sectors of particular interest for LDCs and developing
  countries exports. The list of key sectors used by the MDG indicator 8.7 (i.e.
  agriculture, textile and clothing) might have to be reviewed.

  Average tariffs faced by developing countries, least developed countries and

target: >-
  Realize timely implementation of duty-free and quota-free market access on a
  lasting basis for all least developed countries, consistent with World Trade
  Organization decisions, including by ensuring that preferential rules of
  origin applicable to imports from least developed countries are transparent
  and simple, and contribute to facilitating market access.
indicator_definition: >-
  Similar calculations were already used for the calculation of MDG 8.7 (Average
  tariffs imposed by developed countries on agricultural products and textiles
  and clothing from developing countries). For reference purposes see the
  Millennium Development Goals Report 2015 available at
  http://www.un.org/millenniumgoals/2015_MDG_Report/pdf/MDG%202015%20rev%20(July%201).pdf

  Under review. Proposed removal of reference to SIDS in indicator text given it
  is not referenced in the associated target.
