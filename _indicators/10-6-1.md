  The UN is based on a principle of sovereign equality of all its Member States
  (Article 2, UN Charter). Voting rights in international organizations,
  particularly those under the auspices of the UN system, should respect this
  principle. This indicator aims to measure the degree to which States enjoy
  equal representation in international organizations.
