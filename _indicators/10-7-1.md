  Migrant workers often pay recruitment agencies sums amounting to several
  months' expected wage. This contravenes the ILO Private Employment Agencies
  Convention commitment to abolish such fees. These fees disproportionately
  affect low-skilled, lowincome workers from low-income countries. By reducing
  recruitment costs the disposable incomes of low-income workers are increased
  and inequalities are reduced by enabling people who could otherwise not afford
  to seek employment abroad to do so without ending up in debt bondage.
