This is a development website for collecting and disseminating U.S. data for the Sustainable Development Goals global indicators.

For any guidance on how to use the website, or develop it further for your own country, please refer to the [wiki](https://github.com/GSA/sdg-indicators/wiki).

This project is managed by the Office of the U.S. Chief Statistician with technical support from the Data & Analytics team in GSA's Technology Transformation Services division.

The open source code leverages work originally developed by the [City of Philadelphia](https://beta.phila.gov/posts/open-data-digital-transformation/2016-08-10-citys-new-digital-resource-on-public-health/) and advancements made by the [UK Office of National Statistics](https://github.com/ONSdigital/sdg-indicators).
