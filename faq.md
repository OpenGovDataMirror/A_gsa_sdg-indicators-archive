<h4>This page provides guidance on accessing or contributing to US data for the SDGs.</h4>

**Requesting US Data for the SDGs**
<p>Looking for the most recent US statistics for the SDGs? You can find them on this site under <a href="https://sdg.data.gov/statistics/">US Statistics</a>. We typically update US statistics in the fall of each year; some updates are made a bit later to accommodate existing release schedules. The date of last update and anticipated next update appear in the indicator's national metadata page. Statistics and metadata can be downloaded in csv format.</p>
